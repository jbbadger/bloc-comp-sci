1.  In your own words, explain what clean code is and why it is important.

Clean code is multi-factorial and includes naming conventions that are descriptive
and understandable, creating reusable code which decreases repetition, using comments
only for code with special circumstance, functions only performing a single action or
responsibility, nesting of only up to two levels deep, extracting code where
possible to simplify, and writing code for present use and not future predicted
use.  Clean code is important for clarity, refactoring, and bug finding.

2.  Read this article about Toyota and their use of bad code. Although you may not
yet understand all of the topics discussed, think about another commonly used
object that relies on computers and explain what would happen if the code was
not created to an acceptable standard.

A commonly used object may be a clothes dryer which could overheat and become a
fire hazard if the code was subpar.

3.  Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If
not, refactor the code.

No the function has more than one responsibility and it is over commented.  I
would refactor in this manner:

FUNCTION isFahrenheit(y)
IF y = "F" RETURN true

FUNCTION calculateTemperature(x)
IF isFahrenheit equals true
SET z to (xâˆ’32) * (5/9)       // convert fahrenheit to celsius
ELSE SET z to x * 1.8000 + 32.00   // convert celsius to fahrenheit
PRINT Z
END FUNCTION

4.  Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not.
If not, refactor the code.

It's close to being clean but I would refactor in the following manner:

FUNCTION calcPercent(sum, total)
 IF (total = 0)
 PRINT "Sorry, cannot divide by 0"
 ELSE
 SET percentage to sum / total * 100
 PRINT percentage
END FUNCTION

5.  Using pseudocode, refactor the code for the following examples using the
principles you have learned in this checkpoint.

a. The following function prints the subtotal of a customer's transaction and
receives payment accordingly.

FUNCTION calcTotal(subTotal, discountRate)
   SET total to (subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax))
   PRINT "Your total due is: " + total
   RETURN total
   END function

FUNCTION setReceipt(paymentType)
CALL getPayment RETURN amount
IF paymentType = 'CASH'
    PRINT "Change due: " + amount - calcTotal
ELSE IF paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
    PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " + calcTotal
END IF
END FUNCTION

6.  Square Given an array of integers, find out whether the sum of the integers
is a perfect square. If it is a perfect square, return the square root,
otherwise return the sum.

let arr1 = [6, 1, 6, 3]

function sumArr (arr){
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  return sum;
}

let sumArr1 = sumArr(arr1);

function isSqRootWhole(number){
  let sqRoot = Math.sqrt(number);
  let rndRoot = Math.round(sqRoot);
  return sqRoot === rndRoot;
}

console.log(isSqRootWhole(sumArr1));

7.  Duplicate Given an array of integers, find out whether the array contains
any duplicate elements. The function should return true if any value appears
at least twice in the array, and false if every element is distinct.

let arr1 = [6, 1, 5, 3, 10, 11, 26, 32, 2, 10]
let sortedArr = arr1.sort();

function isDuplicate(arr) {
  let arrNum = 0;
  for(let i=0; i < sortedArr.length; i++){
    if(arrNum === sortedArr[i]){
      return true;
    } else { arrNum = sortedArr[i];}
  }
  return false
}

console.log(isDuplicate(sortedArr));
