Short Answer

Why do programmers use pseudocode?

**They use it to brainstorm code and to use a human based language which can
then be translated to a variety of coding languages.**

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

**Nothing would run or it would error sing pseudocode is a human based language.**

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

**Input two numbers
  If number 1 is greater than number 2
  Print number 1
  Else print number 2**

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

**Input 1 & 100
  Iterate starting at 1 and ending at 100 by 1
  Print each iteration**

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

**Input phonebook
  Specify entry
  Iterate through phonebook
  if iteration equals entry
  return true
  else return false**

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any
computer language of your choice.

** function lookup(phonebook){
   const entry = "Smith";
   for (let i=0; i < phonebook.length; i++){
   if (phonebook[i] == entry){
     return true;
   }
   }
   return false;
   }
**
