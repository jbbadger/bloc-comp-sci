more insight we have, the better we will be to help you grow.

**For weaknesses, the difference between JSX and normal JavaScript can still be
confusing.  My JavaScript still needs a lot of repetition which I've been
supplementing with CodeWars.  Available time is also a concern.  My job is
entering it's busy season and I have an 8 month old son.
Strengths include HTML and CSS which seem easy compared with JavaScript.  Also,
my general persistence is a boon.  Even in the face of extreme doubt and
frustration I'll keep moving forward.**
