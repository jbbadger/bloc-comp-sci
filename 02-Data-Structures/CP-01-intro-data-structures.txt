Exercises
For exercises requiring code, you are free to use the language of your choice.

Give all the code and written answers in a file named intro-data-structures.txt:

1. A line of people at an amusement park ride.
The line is composed of members, represented as strings.
There is a front to the line, as well as a back.
When someone enters the line, place them at the end.
People may leave the line whenever they see fit, and those behind them take their place.
Given the above real-world information, use an array data structure to code the following solution.

a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike.
c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).
d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it does not find the item in the array?
e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?
f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?

let rideLine = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];

function addMemberLast(arr, member){
  arr.push(member);
  return arr;
}

function findMemberPosition(arr, member){
  return arr.indexOf(member);
}

function isMemberInLine(arr, member){
  for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
    if (arr[i] === member)
    return true;
  }
  return member + " not in line"
}

function addMemberMiddle(arr, estMember, newMember){
  estPosition = findMemberPosition(arr, estMember);
  arr.splice(estPosition, 0, newMember);
  return arr;
}

function removeMember (arr, member){
  estPosition = findMemberPosition(arr, member);
  arr.splice(estPosition, 1);
  return arr;
}

console.log(addMemberLast(rideLine, "Mary"));
console.log(findMemberPosition(rideLine, "Josh"));
console.log(isMemberInLine(rideLine, "Emily"));
console.log(addMemberMiddle(rideLine, "Ava", "Melissa"));
console.log(removeMember(rideLine, "Patrick"));

2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.

Here is a first in, last out data structure for a parking driveway:

const toyota = "Bob"
const buick = "Randy"
const ford = "Todd"
let carOrder = [];

function orderInDriveway(front, middle, rear){
  carOrder.push(front, middle, rear);
  return carOrder;
}

function departureOrder(){
  return carOrder.reverse();
}

console.log(orderInDriveway(toyota, buick, ford));
console.log(departureOrder());

3. How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

Any variables could be input to the 3 parking spots depending on who is in the front,
middle, or rear.  Once established, the order is automatically reversed to give information
on the order of departure.
